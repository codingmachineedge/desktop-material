# Multiple accounts and repository identity

Desktop Material can retain multiple GitHub.com identities, multiple accounts
on one Enterprise host, and GitLab or Bitbucket identities. Account metadata is
stored separately from credentials; tokens remain in the operating-system
credential vault.

Repository Settings exposes an exact account binding for provider operations
such as fetch, push, pull requests, issues, Actions, and Releases. The Git tab
independently chooses global or repository-local `user.name` and `user.email`,
so authentication identity and commit authorship are explicit instead of being
silently coupled.

When a saved binding is missing, stale, lacks permission, or needs organization
SSO, the operation stops with the appropriate account-management or sign-in
recovery. A unique valid account may be suggested; ambiguous same-host matches
require a labelled user choice and never replace a still-valid binding.

The accounts store caps and validates persisted metadata, de-duplicates stable
account keys, and never writes tokens to its metadata file or application log.
Repository bindings use stable account keys rather than array positions.

Verification includes `accounts-store-test.ts`,
`get-account-for-repository-test.ts`, `repositories-store-test.ts`,
`push-authenticated-git-test.ts`, and the provider-triage UI/store suites.
